Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect fake news articles based on their content. The data was subjected to preprocessing, stemming and vectorizing using TfidVectorizer. The data was then used to train a LOgistic Regression Model which had a prediction accuracy of 98% on training data and 97% on test data
